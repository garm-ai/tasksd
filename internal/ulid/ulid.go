// Package ulid mints task ids.
//
// A ULID is 26 characters of Crockford base32: 48 bits of millisecond
// timestamp and 80 bits of randomness. It sorts by time as a string, which
// is why the queue's index is the primary key and there is no separate
// created_at ordering, and it carries no counter that two processes would
// have to agree on.
//
// Lowercase, because the id appears in a URL and in a log line and one
// spelling is easier to search for than two.
